    <h1>These are not the droids you are looking for.</h1>

        <p>Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from. I see, sir. Uh,
        you can call me Luke. I see, sir Luke. Just Luke. And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my
        counterpart, Artoo-Detoo. Hello. You got a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot
        of action. With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with
        the Rebellion and all. You know of the Rebellion against the Empire? That's how we came to be in your service,
        if you take my meaning, sir.</p>

        <p>Not after we demonstrate the power of this station. In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet
        that'll be destroyed first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have
        chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan. No! Alderaan is peaceful.
        We have no weapons. You can't possibly... You would prefer another target? A military target? Then name the
        system! I grow tired of asking this. So it'll be the last time. Where is the Rebel base? Dantooine. They're on
        Dantooine.</p>

        <p>Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is
        insignificant next to the power of the Force. Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.
        Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you
        clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort... I find your lack of faith disturbing. Enough of this!
        Vader, release him! As you wish. This bickering is pointless. Lord Vader will provide us with the location of
        the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational. We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift
        stroke.</p>
